# 3-Month Java 11 Mastery Plan

This training plan is designed to master Java 11 and prepare for the Java SE 11 Developer 1Z0-819 certification. It includes a mix of theoretical learning and practical exercises, with a focus on hands-on development in Eclipse to reinforce concepts.

## Week 1-2: Java Basics and Object-Oriented Programming

### Topics
- Java data types, operators, text handling (String, StringBuilder), local variable type inference.
- Object lifecycle, fields, methods, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and enumerations.

### Practice
- Develop simple Java applications that utilize basic data manipulation and object-oriented principles.
- Focus on creating and manipulating objects, implementing inheritance, and interfaces.

### Resources
- Oracle's Java documentation, "Java: The Complete Reference" by Herbert Schildt.

## Week 3-4: Control Flow, Exception Handling, and Arrays

### Topics
- Control flow mechanisms (loops, conditionals, switch), exception handling, arrays, and collections (List, Set, Map, Deque).

### Practice
- Implement various control flow mechanisms and handle exceptions in your programs.
- Work with arrays and collections, focusing on sorting and searching algorithms.

### Resources
- "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch, Oracle tutorials.

## Week 5-6: Generics, Streams, and Lambda Expressions

### Topics
- Generics, using streams for data processing, implementing lambda expressions, functional interfaces.

### Practice
- Use generics for type-safe collections and streams to filter, map, and reduce data.
- Convert anonymous classes to lambda expressions.

### Resources
- Online courses (Coursera, Udemy), Oracle's Java tutorials.

## Week 7: Java Platform Module System and Concurrency

### Topics
- Modular applications, creating worker threads, concurrency management, thread safety.

### Practice
- Develop modular applications and simple concurrent applications to understand Java's concurrency model.

### Resources
- "Java Concurrency in Practice" by Brian Goetz, Oracle documentation.

## Week 8-9: Java I/O, Secure Coding, and JDBC

### Topics
- Java I/O API, security in Java applications, JDBC.

### Practice
- Implement file handling and I/O operations, write secure Java code, create a simple CRUD application using JDBC.

### Resources
- Oracle's security tutorials, JDBC documentation.

## Week 10: Localization and Annotations

### Topics
- Implementing Localization, creating, and processing annotations.

### Practice
- Localize an application, use annotations in Java applications.

### Resources
- Oracle's tutorials, "Effective Java" for annotations best practices.

## Week 11: Review and Practice Problem Sets

### Activities
- Review all topics, focusing on areas of difficulty.
- Solve problem sets related to data structures and algorithms using Java on platforms like LeetCode or CodeSignal.

### Resources
- "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, online coding platforms.

## Week 12: Mock Exams and Final Review

### Activities
- Take practice exams for Java SE 11 Developer 1Z0-819 certification.
- Review challenging topics based on practice exam outcomes.

### Resources
- Official Oracle practice exams, study groups, forums.

## Continuous Practices

- **Code Daily:** Dedicate daily time to coding exercises.
- **Use Eclipse:** Implement practice exercises in Eclipse.
- **Join Communities:** Engage with Java communities for support and knowledge sharing.

This plan is flexible and may need adjustments based on progress and challenges encountered. Regular breaks and balance are essential to avoid burnout.
